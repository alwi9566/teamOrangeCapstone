# Icons

Place your Chrome extension icons here:
- `icon16.png` - 16x16 pixels
- `icon48.png` - 48x48 pixels  
- `icon128.png` - 128x128 pixels

You can create these icons using:
- The RAVEN logo from Figma
- Design tools like Figma, Photoshop, or online icon generators
- Ensure they match your brand colors (Purple #7216C7, Yellow-Green #FFF071)

For now, you can create simple colored squares as placeholders or export the logo from Figma at these sizes.
